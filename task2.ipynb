By selecting a pre-trained model that closely matches the characteristics of the target task, you can streamline the fine-tuning process and maximize the model's adaptability and effectiveness for the intended application.\\n By allowing the whole model to learn from the task-specific data, full fine-tuning can lead to a more profound adaptation of the model to the specific task, potentially resulting in superior performance.\"},\n",
